## How it all started

My fascination with rocketry was ignited back in 2019 when I stumbled upon Joe Barnard a.k.a [BPS.space](https://www.youtube.com/@BPSspace) . As I delved into countless hours of binge-watching his interesting and exciting videos, I was drawn into the world of rocketry, the science behind it, and the precision required to launch and control rockets. Joe Barnard's expertise and passion for rocketry became a beacon, pulling me deeper into the realm of aerospace engineering. The way he broke down complex concepts and made them accessible ignited a spark within me, fueling a burgeoning love for rocketry that eventually led me to the exciting journey at [thrustMIT](https://thrustmit.in).

## The Learning Phase

My journey at thrustMIT started with learning the basics of electronics and coding microcontrollers. I began by understanding simple circuits and components, gradually advancing to programming languages. There were challenges, and I made mistakes, sometimes even causing sensors to blow-up XD. But these missteps taught me valuable lessons. Over time, I improved, moving from errors to constructing reliable prototypes of flight computers and ground stations for our rocket projects and static motor tests. It was a learning phase that laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors in the field of electronics and coding.

I've got to give a big shout-out to my seniors at thrustMIT. They've had the patience of saints, dealing with my rookie mishaps and the occasional sensor fireworks display (yeah, sorry about that!). They've seen it all, from my early coding hiccups to the times I accidentally reversed a circuit.

## Rayquaza: 2022

Rayquza was the first rocket we launched in my time at thrustMIT. With a Carbon Fibre airframe and Aluminium 6063 internal structure, it was powered by a Cesaroni M3400, an M-class commercial rocket engine and reached an apogee of 3.55 km. This was our first rocket ever to reach 10,000 ft. Rayquaza came 4th in the James Barrowman Award with an error percentage less than 0.3 %.

The rocket was launched at Spaceport America in New Mexico. Unfortunately, Rayquaza's parachute failed to deploy and rendered the rocket not-safe for further flights. Despite the setback, this experience became a crucial chapter in our learning journey, prompting a comprehensive review of our design and safety protocols. It fueled our determination to regroup, learn from the failure, and enhance our future projects with newfound insights and expertise.

## Altair: 2023

Altair, inspired by Assassin's Creed. This rocket was our brain-child; we designed, developed, and built this rocket. The journey of building this rocket had ups and downs, and this rocket, in particular, has a lot of stories behind its making. From failed body tubes to a delayed delivery of the rocket, we've experienced everything bad that could happen in designing, building, and launching the rocket.

Altair was launched on the 24th of June 2023, the most successful rocket thrustMIT has ever built at the time of me writing this. Altair reached an apogee of 10,331 feet, successfully deployed its parachute and recovered safely. This rocket made history as it was the first ever rocket to reach our desired apogee and also recover in one piece.

## Testing our Motors

Testing our solid propellant motors was an exhilarating and heart-pounding experience. Conducting these tests at Endpoint Park in Manipal added an extra level of excitement. The powerful ignition and controlled fury of the motors were awe-inspiring, displaying the result of our careful design and engineering. The tests were carefully planned, ensuring safety was a priority, leading to successful trials. Each test affirmed our dedication and hard work, bringing us closer to our rocketry objectives.

## Thank You thrustMIT

My journey at thrustMIT, from the challenges faced with Rayquaza to the triumph of Altair, has been nothing short of transformative. As the Avionics Head and the Safety Operations Lead at Spaceport America Cup for my team, the experiences have been both arduous and rewarding. Rayquaza brought the reality check, teaching us valuable lessons through failures and setbacks. Finally, Altair showcased our resilience and growth, a testament to our determination and hard work. These projects shaped me, imparting invaluable knowledge and a deep appreciation for teamwork and perseverance. Thank you, thrustMIT, for providing the platform to learn, stumble, and ultimately rise, stronger and more determined than before.
